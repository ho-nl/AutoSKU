SSE_AutoSku
====

This Magento extension sets up automatically generated SKUs, similar to order numbers.

To install it manually, copy the directories "app" and "shell" into your Magento installation.

How it works
----

Every time you save a product without specifying the SKU, the SKU will be autogenerated (also applies for duplicating products).
If for some reason there already is a product with the generated SKU, the next number will be chosen.

If you import products where you want to autogenerate the SKU, use an SKU value starting with "tmp",
because without any SKU Magento cannot understand the import file.
There is also a script to generate SKUs for existing products with empty or temporary SKUs.
You can call it on the command line with "php shell/autosku.php"

Autogenerated SKUs start at S100, S101, S102, ...

TBD
----

* Make SKU format configurable (currently hard coded in `SSE_AutoSku_Model_Resource_Setup`).
* More configuration
* Better documentation
